TCP proposal for communication from the input/control -unit -> R.PI board:

* Servo will have four states Off, Decrease, Increase, Reset [2 bits] * 2
[00 OFF] [01 INC] [10 DEC] [11 RESET]

* Laser needs two states Off, On [1 bit]
[0 OFF] [1 ON]

* Reserved for future uses. (Camera activation for example) [3 bits]

Data layout:
[ Servo1 | Servo2 | Laser | Reserved ] = Total 8 bits (1 char)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TCP proposal for communication from the R.PI board -> input/control -unit:

When the inputdevice is connected the turret sends the current values.

* Servo sends char with the current angle [8 bits] * 2
[0 - 256]

* Laser sends a boolean describing the current state [1 bit]
[0 OFF] [1 ON]

Data layout:
[Servo1] [Servo2] [Laser] = Total 17 bits (2 chars and 1 boolean)
